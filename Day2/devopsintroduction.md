# DevOps = Practice • Culture • Principles

## DevOps Principles

1. **Flow** – Smooth movement of work from development → operations → customers
2. **Feedback** – Fast feedback loops for quick learning and correction
3. **Continual Improvement & Learning** – Always improving processes, tools, and culture

# DORA Metrics (DevOps Research & Assessment)

## Deployment Frequency
=> How often do we deploy code to production?

**It shows:**

* How fast you deliver new features
* Maturity of CI/CD pipelines
* Speed of the overall team

**Problems it solves:**

* Slow releases
* Manual deployment delays
* Risky “big-bang” deployments

-----------------------------------

## Lead Time for Changes
=> How long does it take from code commit → production?

**It shows:**

* Speed from idea → usable software
* Efficiency of pipelines, testing, and code reviews

**Problems it solves:**

* Long build wait times
* Slow approvals
* Manual testing bottlenecks
* Poor Dev–Ops collaboration

-------------------------------------------

## Change Failure Rate
=> What percentage of deployments cause incidents?*

**It shows:**

* Release quality
* Production stability

**Problems it solves:**

* Frequent hotfixes
* Post-deployment instability
* Unexpected downtime
* Customer complaints due to broken releases

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
=> How long to recover when something breaks?

**It shows:**

* Incident response maturity
* How quickly services are restored
* Strength of monitoring & runbooks

**Problems it solves:**

* Long outages
* Poor visibility into failures
* Slow debugging
* Lack of automation in recovery
